#### Requirements

- WordPress >= 4.0 or ClassicPress 1.0
- PHP ^5.6 or ^7.0

#### Installation

If you're using Composer to manage WordPress, add Papi to your project's dependencies. Run:

```
composer require wp-papi/papi
```

Or manually add it to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "php": "^5.5.9 || ^7.0",
    "wordpress": "^4.0",
    "wp-papi/papi": "^3.0"
  }
}
```
