#### Requirements

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) >= 4.0 or [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/) 1.0

composer require wp-papi/papi
```

Or manually add it to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "php": "^5.5.9 || ^7.0",
    "wordpress": "^4.0",
    "wp-papi/papi": "^3.0"
  }
}
```
